We were to use Bootstrap to build out this site. I got this idea due to the numerous tattoo shop around Tampa that didn't have a website. This took place during peak covid season. I learned during this project the use of rows and columns that Bootstrap asks for in a responsive design. I also had fun getting the carousel to work properly. I figured if I was going to freelance, this is how I get startedâ€”showcasing my work.`

One of the most challenging parts of this project was getting the API blueprint correct. I was going to use PostgreSQL to build out the backend. I ran into many obstacles with this program, which is still being worked on. The only reason why this project is listed here is to show my workflow when issues arise and how I overcome them. '

The database I decided to use was "The Move Database" or TMDB for short. I initially started this project as a Netflix look alike, but I didn't want to follow what all programmers do. So I started designing my own little movie database. It was probably the first time I realized I had built a website, not just following a lesson plan, but an actual site I can call my own. I was proud of my accomplishments.`
