## About

Hello, my name is Cristian Vega. I am a Web Design and Development student at Full Sail University. I began this journey so that I can acquire the skills to create beautiful, usable, and professional websites. During my studies, the goal I wish to accomplish is to push myself and retain the information provided to me. Some things about my personal life, I'm a content creator for YouTube and Twitch. I also enjoy cruising on my motorcycle, playing with my 2 rescued dogs, and general outdoor activities.

I created this single page application using ReactJS, EmailJS, CSS, and deployed on Heroku. I have spent the last 2 years learning about Frontend and Backend practices. Learned a myriad of coding languages to better help me become a well verse programer.
